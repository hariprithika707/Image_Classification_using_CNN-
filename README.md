# Image Classification Using Deep Learning

## Overview

This project demonstrates how images, specifically natural scene images like buildings, forests, seas, glaciers, mountains, and streets, can be classified using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

## What is CNN and Why CNN?

A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is a supervised learning technique that requires both input data and target output data for training. CNNs are effective for image classification tasks because they automatically learn to detect important features in images, making them a powerful tool for this kind of work.

### Key Components of CNN:

1. **Convolutional Layer**: Takes the input image and applies multiple filters to create a feature map.
2. **Pooling Layer**: Reduces the dimensionality of the feature map by selecting only the most important features.
3. **Fully Connected Dense Network**: Flattens the pooled features and uses backpropagation to learn weights for accurate classification.

### Motivation Behind CNN

CNNs are designed to analyze and classify images by examining small sections (windows) at a time, generating feature maps for each section, and extracting the most relevant features. This built-in feature extraction capability reduces the need for additional preprocessing and makes CNNs particularly effective for image classification tasks.

## Getting Started

To begin, use the Anaconda Navigator to open Jupyter Notebook and start implementing the code.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following libraries installed in your local environment:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `tensorflow`
- `keras`
- `os`
